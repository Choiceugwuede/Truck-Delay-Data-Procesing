# üöõ Truck Delay Data Processing
## Overview

This project focuses on storing, retrieving, analyzing, and processing logistics data to understand factors contributing to truck delays. 
Timely delivery is crucial for logistics companies, and analyzing past data helps improve efficiency.

## Key Objectives
-  Store logistics data in PostgreSQL and MySQL on AWS RDS
-  Retrieve and analyze the data using SQL & Python
-  Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights
-  Engineer features to make the data more structured for further use

## üìä Data Description
The dataset consists of multiple tables:

- City Weather: Weather data for various cities
- Routes: Truck routes with origin, destination, distance, and travel time
- Drivers: Truck driver details, including experience
- Routes Weather: Weather conditions specific to each route
- Trucks: Information about trucks in logistics operations
- Traffic: Traffic-related data
- Truck Schedule: Truck scheduling and timing details

## üöÄ What Was Done
1Ô∏è‚É£ Database Setup
-  Created AWS RDS instances for MySQL and PostgreSQL
-  Configured MySQL Workbench and pgAdmin4 for managing databases

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Analysis & Retrieval
-  Queried the database using SQL for initial exploration
-  Fetched the data into Python for further analysis

3Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-  Explored truck routes, weather impact, and traffic trends
-  Visualized key patterns using Matplotlib & Seaborn

4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Processing & Feature Engineering
-  Cleaned and structured the data for better usability
-  Created derived features for deeper analysis
- Created a final dataset for modelling and further analysis.
